A control group is a group of related style controls, for an Instrument.
An Instrument usually has an analog in Qt, e.g. QPen, QBrush, etc.

Here, SOME of the instruments (Pen and Brush) have an additional property: role.
The role is used for DocumentElements having many parts (e.g. frame and body.)
The instrument may style only one part, and the role tells that part.
