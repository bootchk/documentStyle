This directory is user interface of StyleSheetDialog and its components.

It contains two implementations:
- qmlUI
- qwidgetUI

You don't need the code for both (you can exclude one from freeze.)

A StyleDialogFactory knows which one you are using,
and selectively imports on of the two.
(There is no performance issue for selective import: Python caches it.)

There are other traces and selective imports of the QWidget implementation in Formation.

Note that layout is specific to QWidget implementation, but cannot be excluded
(Formations are initialized with a Layout factory.)

OLD:  Switch back and forth by changing styleDialog.py:
inherit from StyleDialogWidget or StyleDialogQML.
